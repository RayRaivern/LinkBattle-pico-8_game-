# Link Battle (pico-8 game)
## Description
This game was coded using Pico-8 virtual machine and game engine. It consists of a controllable player sprite with basic defense and attack function. The game is still incomplete so all features may not be present.

## Files
- **linkbattle.p8:** Contains my code for the game, including all the pixel art. (All the code and art was done by me)
- **linkbattle.html**: Playable HTML file of the game, MUST have the **.js** file to run properly.
